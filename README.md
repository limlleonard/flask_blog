# Flask Blog
## Description
[Link to open the blog](https://test-flask-blog-6ztu.onrender.com)

This project is inspired (stolen) from a flask tutorial video serie from [Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwZwr5Tvyxo&list=PL-osiE80TeTs4UjLw5MM6OjgkjFeUxCYH).

I have always liked building things. Flask makes it possible to build a interactive website with my first programming language python. Meanwhile it would be a nice place for someone introverse like me to post some ideas about different topics.

## Progress
This project will be iteratively build up.
### Todos
- Topic tags
- Remove registration function (Don't know if anyone would post anything here)
### Done
- Connect to my own Postgresql database
- Remove pictures
### My takeaway
- Password hash
- Flask template
